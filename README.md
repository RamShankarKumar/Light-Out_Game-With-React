# Introduction

* I have put the name of this game as Light-Out. Basically player has to switch off all the light in each of the cell of the game board.

* The logic behind this game is that :
    -- When a player click on a cell, it gets off as well as the cells which is aroung that clicked cell also gets off.

    -- When a player click on a cell, it gets on as well as the cells which is aroung that clicked cell also gets on.

    -- If a you manage to switch off all the cells light, you will be the winner of this game. Take a challenge play!!!! You will love it.
